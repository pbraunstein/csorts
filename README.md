# csorts

### What is this?
This repo is a number of different sorting algorithms implemented in C.

## Usage
#### Compile
`make`

#### Run Test Suite
`make test`

#### Run Stress Test
`make stressTest`

### Sorts implemented
* Insertion Sort (isort.c)
* Selection Sort (ssort.c)
* Bubble Sort (bsort.c)
* Quick Sort (qsort.c)

### Why?
Learning about different sorting algorithms was the first topic I really fell in love with in the realm of computer science. It's fun to revisit it. Also -- it's been awhile since I've written anything in C. Also Also -- it was fun to create the test suite.
